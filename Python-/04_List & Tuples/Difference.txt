**Difference between Lists and Tuples**

Mutability:
Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after creation.
Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.

Syntax:
Lists are defined using square brackets: list_example = [1, 2, 3].
Tuples are defined using parentheses: tuple_example = (1, 2, 3).

Performance:
Tuples are generally faster than lists because of their immutability.
Lists are slower compared to tuples due to their dynamic nature.

Memory Usage:
Tuples use less memory than lists.
Lists consume more memory because they are mutable and can grow dynamically.

Methods:
Lists have several built-in methods like append(), remove(), pop(), etc.
Tuples have fewer built-in methods, mainly for counting and finding elements.

Use Cases:
Lists are suitable for collections of items that may need to be modified.
Tuples are suitable for collections of items that should not change, ensuring data integrity.
